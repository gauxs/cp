# Monotonic Queue/Stack
Monotonic Queue is a data structure that keeps itâ€™s elements either entirely in non-increasing, or entirely in non-decreasing order. For some problems just a stack can be of use, although for a more standardized approach we can apply queue (or deque).

1. A monotonic decreasing stack is a stack that will produce, when popping its elements a sequence that:
    - is monotonically decreasing
    - respects the FIFO ordering of the input
    - includes the last item stacked (i.e. it can purge items greater than it).
2. A monotonic queue, also known as a double-ended queue, refers to a data structure in which each element monotonically increases or decreases with its subscript. ***The elements can be deleted at both the beginning and end of the queue, but they can only be inserted at the end (i.e. back of the deque).*** Since the elements are monotonic, the head element is either the maximum or minimum value depending on which monotonic queue you are constructing (decreasing or increasing order, *the order of elements is from front to end of the deque*). Due to the nature of the double-ended queue, each element is enqueued once and dequeued at most once. Thus, the computational complexity of maintaining a monotonic queue is O(n).
3. Since a monotonic stack can be implemented via a deque, generally deque's are used for solving these questions.
