# Radix Sort
Digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

Is Radix Sort preferable to comparison based sorting algorithms like Quick-Sort? 
>If we have log2n bits for every digit, the running time of Radix appears to be better than Quick Sort for a wide range of input numbers. The constant factors hidden in asymptotic notation are higher for Radix Sort and Quick-Sort uses hardware caches more effectively. Also, Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine and counting sort takes extra space to sort numbers.

### Algorithm Analysis
```
    D - digits in input integers
    N - number of elements
    B - base for representing numbers, e.g. for the decimal system, B is 10
    K - range of input(for counting sort) which is constant here i.e 10

    Time complexity:    O(D*(N+B))
    What is the value of D? If k is the maximum possible value, then d would be O(logB(k)) (B is at log base). So overall time complexity is 
    O((N+B)*logB(K)). Which looks more than the time complexity of comparison-based sorting algorithms for a large K. Let us first limit K. 
    Let K<=N^C where C is a constant. In that case, the complexity becomes O(N*logB(N)). But it still doesnâ€™t beat comparison-based sorting 
    algorithms.

    What if we make the value of B larger?. What should be the value of B to make the time complexity linear? If we set B as N, we get the 
    time complexity as O(N). In other words, we can sort an array of integers with a range from 1 to N^C if the numbers are represented in 
    base N (or every digit takes log2(N) bits).

    Space complexity:   O(N+K)
    Inplace sorting:    No
    Stable sorting:     Yes
```
