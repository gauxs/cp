# Counting Sort
Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then using arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence. Counting sort can be used to sort a string since range is fixed i.e 26

### Algorithm Analysis
```
    N - size of input
    K - range of input

    Time complexity:    O(N+K)
    Space complexity:   O(N+K)
    Inplace sorting:    No
    Stable sorting:     Yes
```
