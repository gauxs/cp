# Bucket Sort
Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range. 

### Algorithm Analysis
```
    N - Size of input

    Time complexity:     
    1. Worst:           O(N)
    2. Average:         O(N)
    3. Best:            O(N)

    Space complexity:   O(N)
    Inplace sorting:    No
    Stable sorting:     Yes
```
