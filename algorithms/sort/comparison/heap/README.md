# Heap Sort
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning.

### Algorithm Analysis
```
    N - Size of input

    Time Complexity:   
    1.  Worst:      O(Nlog(N))
    2.  Average:    O(Nlog(N))
    3.  Best:       O(Nlog(N))

    Space Complexity:   O(1)
    Inplace Sorting:    yes
    Stable Sorting:     no, but can be made stable 
```
