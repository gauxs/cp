# Minimum spanning trees
Given a **weighted, undirected graph** **G** with **V** vertices and **E** edges, find a spanning tree of this graph which connects all vertices and has the least weight (i.e. the sum of weights of edges is minimal). 

A **spanning tree** is a set of edges such that any vertex can reach any other by exactly one simple path. The spanning tree with the least weight is called a **minimum spanning tree**. Any spanning tree will **necessarily** contain Vâˆ’1 edges.
