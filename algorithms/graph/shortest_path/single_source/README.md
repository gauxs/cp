# Single Pair Shortest Path Algorithms

You are given a directed or undirected weighted graph with **V** vertices and **E** edges. You are also given a starting vertex **s**. Find the lengths of the shortest paths from a starting vertex **s** to all other vertices. This problem is also called **single-source shortest paths problem**.
