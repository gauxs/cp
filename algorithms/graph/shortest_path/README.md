# Shortest Path Algorithms

You are given a directed or undirected weighted graph with **V** vertices and **E** edges. 

You are given a starting vertex **s**. Find the lengths of the shortest paths from a starting vertex **s** to all other vertices. This problem is called **single-source shortest paths problem**.

Another variation of the problem is finding the lengths of the shortest paths between each pair of vertices. This problem is called **all pair shortest paths problem**.
