# Breadth first search

The path found by breadth first search to any node is the shortest path to that node, i.e the path that contains the smallest number of edges in unweighted graphs.

## Algorithm Analysis
```
    V-total number of nodes in the graph
    E-total number of edges in the graph

    Time complexity:    O(V+E)
    Space complexity:   O(V)        // when first node is connected to all the other unvisited nodes.
```
